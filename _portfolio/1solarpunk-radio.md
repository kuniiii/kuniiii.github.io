This is work-in-progress investigation that explores how to utilize generative AI for envisioning desired futures, contrasting to the AI apocalypse naysayer perspective. In this project, a vintage radio will be repurposed to generate desired futures at the stations it is tuned to. We are inspired by the solarpunk genre, that depicts positive futures where mankind and nature lives in harmony.
