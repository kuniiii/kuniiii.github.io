I was the solo designer and web developer for an experimental application to support futures design education at the Willem de Koning Academy in Rotterdam. Working together with a futurist, I built an app for collecting weak signals for watching trends. The app was used throughout a semester long project for data collection and data analysis on the future of retail.

### My role
I worked as a full-stack designer and developer on this app. The app was developed based on Meteor.js, which was the cutting edge in 2015, and enabled building a full-fledged application with user authentication, and providing a smooth experience on web and mobiles. After the project I left for doing a PhD, and unfortunately the app has not been used further.
