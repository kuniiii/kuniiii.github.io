# About

I am Peter Kun, a postdoc design researcher focused on creative technology at the Media, Art, and Design group at the IT University of Copenhagen. Through an interaction design practice, I study new ways of experiencing art enabled by generative artificial intelligence. I have researched creative data work since my PhD in the cross-sections of design research and data science at TU Delft.
