<!-- # Hello! ðŸ‘‹ -->
I am Peter Kun, a postdoc design researcher focused on creative technology at the Media, Art, and Design group at the IT University of Copenhagen. Through an interaction design practice, I study new ways of experiencing art enabled by generative artificial intelligence. I have researched creative data work since my PhD in the cross-sections of design research and data science at TU Delft.

I'm in the middle of moving my portfolio to another hosting, so if you happened to open this right now (~November 2023), you are a lucky person to see behind the scenes! Until then, you can reach me at peter ðŸ¦€ peterkun ðŸ¦€ com or hit me up on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterkun/)!
