# Hello! 👋
I am Peter Kun, a postdoc design researcher focused on creative technology at the Media, Art, and Design group at the IT University of Copenhagen. Through an interaction design practice, I study new ways of experiencing art enabled by generative artificial intelligence. I have researched creative data work since my PhD in the cross-sections of design research and data science at TU Delft.

I'm in the middle of migrating my portfolio to another hosting, so if you happened to open this right now, you get a 🏆 – consider yourself lucky to observe the great migration. Until then, you can reach me at peter 🪱 peterkun . com!
