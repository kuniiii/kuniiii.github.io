# Hello! ðŸ‘‹
I am Peter Kun, a designer and HCI/AI research scientist, with an academic background in merging design thinking with data, ML and AI. Currently, I'm working as a designer at [Complexio](https://complexio.com/), exploring how enterprises will live together with AI agents eliminating mundane tasks. In my practice, I build proof-of-concepts, interactive prototypes, and use a wide qualitative and quantitative research toolbox. My sweet spot is combining deep technical nerdery with finding meaningful, human-centered utility of AI/ML and creative technologies.

I am always keen to talk shop on discovery and exploratory problems in the AI space. For anything, reach me at peter ðŸ¦€ peterkun ðŸ¦€ com or hit me up on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterkun/)!

Previously I was a postdoc design researcher focused on creative technology at the [Media, Art, and Design group at the IT University of Copenhagen](https://mad.itu.dk), studying new ways of experiencing art enabled by generative AI. I have researched creative data work since my PhD at TU Delft.
