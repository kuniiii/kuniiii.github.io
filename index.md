# Hello! 👋
I am Peter Kun, a postdoc design researcher focused on creative technology at the Media, Art, and Design group at the IT University of Copenhagen. Through an interaction design practice, I study new ways of experiencing art enabled by generative artificial intelligence. I have researched creative data work since my PhD in the cross-sections of design research and data science at TU Delft.

I'm in the middle of moving my portfolio to another hosting, so if you happened to open this right now (November 2023), you get a 🍪 – consider yourself lucky for the behind the scenes perspective (why not build in production? yolo!). Until then, you can reach me at peter 🪱 peterkun . com or hit me up on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterkun/)! {: .notice--info}
